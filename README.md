## Description
 - Once on the homepage, the user will be presented with a list of movies to choose from. Upon selecting a movie, a new page will be displayed showing reviews and ratings left by previous users. Upon trying to leave a review and rating, the user will be prompted to log in if not already signed in. If the user does not have login credentials, they will be prompted to create an account with an username, email, and password. Upon doing so they will be logged in. Then the user will be able to leave a review and rating and can return to the homepage and select other movies to leave reviews and ratings for if they chose to do so.
